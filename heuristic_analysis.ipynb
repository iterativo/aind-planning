    "At first glance, it appears that the most efficient search algorithm among the 3 compared is depth_first_graph_search. On each of the scenarios, the number of Expansions and Time Elapsed is significantly lower than the ones showed by the other two algorightms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take for example Air Cargo Problem 1. In that case, depth_first only needs 12 node Expansions before reaching a solution, whereas breadth_first and uniform_cost need 43 and 55 respectively (>300% expansions). Also, Time Elapsed is significantly lower for depth_first (9msecs as compared to 26 and 32). However, the Plan Length under depth_first turns out to be twice as much as in the other 2 cases (12 steps as opposed to 6). \n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is reflected in all the cargo problems. Most noticeably, for Air Cargo Problem 3, the Plan Length for depth_first is 596, whereas for both breadth_first and uniform_cost it's only 12. Nonetheless, the Time Elapsed for them is 1-1/2 mins and 47 secs respectively, whereas it is only 3 secs for depth_first. This shows that depth_first shows potential benefits as far as efficiency, but very poor benefits when it comes to optimality. On the other hand, both breadth_first and uniform_cost are significantly more effective (optimal), but less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In hindsight, this apparent behavior makes sense though. The depth_first approach deals with exploring a possible path until the end before trying an alternative path. This approach causes the algorithm to find a solution (meet the goal) faster in our case, as it tries to hop from airport to airport while testing the goal. The outcome is a sub-optimal solution found in relatively short time, making the plan length found by depth_first obviously high.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the breadth_first approach deals with testing all possible immediate alternatives before digging deeper into the next available path segments. This approach, although obviously slower, produces more optimal results; i.e., shorter plan lengths. A similar, yet more efficient outcome to breath_first is shown by uniform_cost. This is because this search algorithm underneath the covers is using a best_first approach (with a constant cost function in our case), which in practicallity produces as a more greedy breadth-first tree expansion."
